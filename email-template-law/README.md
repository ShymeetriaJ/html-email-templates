table-based layouts and inline CSS for maximum compatibility across all 
major email clients including Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

## Template Provided

### 1. Law Firm — Godfrey & Associates
- Navy blue and gold color scheme
- Professional legal disclaimer in footer
- Clean formal layout ideal for legal correspondence

---

## Why Table-Based Layout?

This template uses HTML tables for layout instead of modern CSS techniques 
like flexbox or grid. This is intentional. Email clients like Outlook use 
Microsoft Word's rendering engine which does not support modern CSS layout 
methods. A Table-based layout ensures consistent rendering across all email 
clients.

## How To Customize

The template uses placeholder text in brackets that can be easily replaced:

- `[Client Name]` — Replace with the recipient's name
- `[Attorney Name]` — Replace with sender's name

To change the color scheme, search for the hex color codes and replace them 
with your preferred colors. This template uses two to three main colors 
consistently throughout.
