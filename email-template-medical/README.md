## Template Provided

### 1. Medical Office — Riverside Medical Center
- Clean blue and white color scheme
- Appointment information highlight box
- Calm, trustworthy design for healthcare communication

## Why Table-Based Layout?

This template uses HTML tables for layout instead of modern CSS techniques 
like flexbox or grid. This is intentional. Email clients like Outlook use 
Microsoft Word's rendering engine which does not support modern CSS layout 
methods. A Table-based layout ensure consistent rendering across all email 
clients.

## How To Customize

Each template uses placeholder text in brackets that can be easily replaced:

- `[Client Name]` — Replace with the recipient's name
- `[Doctor Name]` — Replace with sender's name
- `[Appointment Date]` / `[Appointment Time]` — Replace with actual appointment details

To change the color scheme, search for the hex color codes and replace them 
with your preferred colors. This template uses two to three main colors 
consistently throughout.
